% function [S,f] = mataa_realFT0 (s,t);
%
% DESCRIPTION:
% Calculates the complex fourier-spectrum S of a real signal s for frequencies f >= 0. Only the half spectrum corresponding to positive frequencies is returned, because for a real signal S(-f)=S*(f). This implies that the RMS level of S is only half the RMS level of the full (symmetric) Fourier spectrum.
% s can be of any length (no padding to length of 2n or even length necessary). In order to avoid frequency leakage, mataa_realFT does NOT pad s to even length. Each column of s represents one audio channel.
%
% INPUT:
% s: signal samples (vector containing the real-valued samples)
% t: time values of the signal samples (vector, with evenly spaced values) or sample rate (scalar)
%
% OUTPUT:
% S: complex fourier spectrum of s ('positive' half, see also DESCRIPTION).
% f: frequency values (vector)
