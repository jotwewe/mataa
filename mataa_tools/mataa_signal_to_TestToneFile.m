% function pathToFile = mataa_signal_to_TestToneFile (s,pathToFile,zeroTime,fs);
%
% DESCRIPTION:
% Saves the test signals in matrix s to a file on disk (for use with TestTone). Optionally, the signals are  padded with zeroes at the beginning and the end.
%
% INPUT:
% s: the signal samples (in the range of [-1..+1]). In general, s is a matrix with each column corresponding to one data channel, and each row corresponding to a signal frame (i.e. all samples corresponding to the same time step). For single-channel data (i.e. mono signals), s is a column vector. A warning will be printed if s has more columns than rows.
%
% pathToFile (optional): the path (including the file name) of the destination file. If not specified, a temporary file will be used. If you want to specify zeroTime and fs, but not pathToFile, use pathToFile = '';
%
% zeroTime (optional): duration of 'zero signal' to be padded to the beginning and the end of the signal (in seconds). If not specified, no zeros will be padded to the signal.
%
% fs (only if zeroTime is specified): the sample rate of the signal (in Hz). This is required to determine the number of 'zero samples'.
% 
% OUTPUT:
% pathToFile: the path (including the file name) of the file to which the data was written.
% 
% NOTE 1: TestTone assumes that all information regarding the sample rate / time interval in between the samples is handled appropriately. mataa_signal_to_TestToneFile therefore does NOT handle any sample timing information. Only the sample VALUES are written to disk.
%
% NOTE 2: the data in s should be padded with zeros at the beginning and the end of the signal to avoid problems with sound-I/O latency. If s does not include zeros at the beginning and the end, use the zeroTime option.
